# QBS 181 Data Wrangling Final Project

**Dataset and Analysis**

The Child and Adult Healthcare Quality Measures Quality data set is a collection of measures used to appraise healthcare per state. Every state is displayed with the measures they have used to appraise the quality of care in different domains of healthcare

We want to compare how healthcare quality is measured across different states, as well compare not only how healthcare has improved over a year, using the 2019 and 2020 versions of this dataset, but also, how reporting how the quality of healthcare has changed.

We want to see how insurance coverage affects the measures chosen and reported on per state, as well as what methodology is chosen for the measure, and how coverage affects this.
