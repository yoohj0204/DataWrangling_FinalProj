This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
#install.packages("tidycensus")
library(tidycensus)
library(httr) 
library(jsonlite)
#install.packages("sqldf")
library(sqldf)
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
# I will figure out API later
# res2019 = GET("https://data.medicaid.gov/dataset/e36d89c0-f62e- 56d5-bc7e-b0adf89262b8")
# res2020=GET("https://data.medicaid.gov/dataset/fbbe1734-b448-4e5a-bc94-3f8688534741")
# data2019=fromJSON(rawToChar(res2019$content))

```



```{r}
data2019=read.csv("/Users/xing/Desktop/QBS 181/2019data.csv")
data2020=read.csv("/Users/xing/Desktop/QBS 181/2020data.csv")

data=sqldf("select * from data2019
      union
      select * from data2020")

```

```{r}
#Remove dot from column names
names(data) <- gsub("\\.", "", names(data))
names(data)
```


```{r}
#Table for kate
higher=sqldf("select State, avg(StateRate) as StateRate_mean
from data
where MeasureType like 'Higher%'
group by State
order by StateRate_mean desc
      ")

lower=sqldf("select State, avg(StateRate) as StateRate_mean
from data
where MeasureType like 'Lower%'
group by State
order by StateRate_mean 
      ")
```

```{r}

```



Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
